## Artiz Mektebi: A Brief History and Analysis of the Show
  
Artiz Mektebi was created by Haldun Dormen, a veteran actor, director and playwright who is considered one of the pioneers of modern Turkish theater. Dormen was inspired by his own experiences in the Turkish film industry, as well as by the works of famous filmmakers such as Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty Python. He wanted to create a show that would expose the absurdities and contradictions of the Turkish cinema and its society.
  
The show was produced by STR YapÄ±m, a company founded by Sinan Ãetin, a young and ambitious director who later became one of the most successful and controversial figures in Turkish cinema. Ãetin was also one of the main actors in Artiz Mektebi, playing the role of a naive and enthusiastic film student who idolized Dormen's character. The show also featured other talented actors such as Osmantan ErkÄ±r, who played a cynical and sarcastic film critic, MÃ¼jde Ar, who played a glamorous and seductive actress, and NurgÃ¼l YeÅilÃ§ay, who played a naive and innocent village girl who wanted to become a star.
  
The show was filmed in various locations in Istanbul, such as the BeyoÄlu district, where many cinemas and theaters were located, and the YeÅilÃ§am street, which was the center of the Turkish film industry. The show used a mix of genres and styles, such as musicals, westerns, horror films, documentaries and mockumentaries. The show also made references to many famous Turkish and foreign films, such as The Godfather, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind and Star Wars.
  
The show was very popular among the Turkish audience, especially among the young and urban people who could relate to the humor and satire of the show.

However, the show also faced some challenges and controversies. The show was often censored by TRT, which was controlled by the military government at the time. Some scenes and dialogues were cut or changed due to political or moral reasons. For example, in one episode, Dormen's character made a joke about AtatÃ¼rk, the founder of modern Turkey, which was considered taboo by TRT. The show also faced some lawsuits from some people who claimed that the show defamed or insulted them or their professions. For example, in one episode, Dormen's character made fun of a famous Turkish singer named Zeki MÃ¼ren, who sued him for slander.
  
The show ended after 13 episodes due to various reasons. Some sources say that Dormen decided to end the show because he felt that he had exhausted his ideas and creativity. Some sources say that Ãetin decided to end the show because he wanted to focus on his own film projects. Some sources say that TRT decided to end the show because it was too controversial and expensive to produce.
  
Regardless of the reasons, Artiz Mektebi remains one of the most memorable and influential shows in Turkish television history. It is widely regarded as a cult classic that has inspired many other comedians and filmmakers in Turkey and beyond. It is also a valuable source of information and insight into the Turkish film industry and its culture in the 1980s.
